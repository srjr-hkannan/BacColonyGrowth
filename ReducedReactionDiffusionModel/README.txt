To run simulations for the quasi-static case, run the time_change_colony.m file:


Notes:

Change the path variable in time_change_colony.m to the path needed. That will be the folder that stores the results. The result will be a Matlab matrix recording the concentration at a given time.

The current code is assuming height of radius = 27*hour-5, height  = 100 + hour*1.24. Change the height and radius parameter if needed to change the different hours.

Output:

The program will save intermediate results of concentration in the matrix format.
